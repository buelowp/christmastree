# Neopixle Christmas Tree

This is a simple project that uses a cardboard cone to make the shape of a tree,
green yarn to make it look like a tree, and a Neopixel strip from Adafruit
which gets wrapped around the cardboard. The strip is then controlled via small
wires by a Photon.

The Photon allows me to upload new programs easily, and provides the ability
to change which program is running dynamically.
